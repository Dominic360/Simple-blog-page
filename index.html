                    There are days which occur in this climate,
                    at almost any season of the year, wherein the world
                    reaches its perfection, when the air, the heavenly bodies,
                    and the earth, make a harmony, as if nature would indulge 
                    her offspring; when, in these bleak upper sides of the planet, 
                    nothing is to desire that we have bask in the shining hours 
                    of Utah and Colorado; when everything... that has life gives 
                    sign of satisfaction, and the cattle that lie on the ground 
                    seem to have great and tranquil thoughts.
